# ChessJavaScript
Chess made only with JS.

Hi, I was enjoing a lot play chess on the last weeks, and decided to RESTART the project to make a playable chess game with only JS.

# Why restart?
If you check on my other repositorie Mochila_Mich you'll see that it has some chess files over there too. But my JS was poor and i made the hole logic of the thing really really bad, and couldn't get pass the check and checkmate stuff.
I've improved a lot my JS since that, never stoped studying, but I was not doing any project and commiting to GitHub (wich i feel bad today), just a lot of small things.

# Why only JS?
From all languages that I studied, the one that i felt most comfortable with was JS, i just love it.

# Why only first commiting after all this code? (check commit 2)
I was not sure if I was gonna to be able to pass the check and checkmate stuff, because I could not the last time (that as I said, made with really really bad logics). Now I've made it and I'm very ambicious with what I can reach with this code, that yet has a lot to improve, but with way better logics happening already. So I'l be documenting here my next steps with the game.

# To do:

Pawn: en passant.
Pawn: promotion.

King: rook.

Add: a button to switch point of view and mirror the board, putting all pieces on it respective position.
Add: single player mode, with automatic moves for the CPU.
Add: api usages to give to the user the FEN of the board and others stuff.
Add: undo and redo button.
Add: match replays.
and more.

(code with comments will prob not always be up to date).
